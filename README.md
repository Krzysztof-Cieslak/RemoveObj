# RemoveObj

No more annoying caching problems, failing builds, or random VS crashes... well I guess that last problem is not really fixable. RemoveObj brings new quality to developer user experiance on .Net platform and is one of the most crucial tool for any .Net developer. It traverses your solution (starting from current directory), finds all project files, and removes `obj` folder placed next to them.

# How to use

0. Install .Net Core 2.1
1. `dotnet tool install -g removeobj`
2. `removeobj`

## How to contribute

*Imposter syndrome disclaimer*: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can [read here](https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/RemoveObj/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
